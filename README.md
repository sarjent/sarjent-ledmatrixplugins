## Display Layout

```text
[NFL DRAFT LOGO]  [TEAM LOGO]  Player Name
                               #1  QB  (Indiana)
```

Each pick card scrolls horizontally. During live draft, a **ROUND X** label precedes the picks and the next pick shows **On the Clock** in green.

## Live Draft Mode

The plugin detects the draft automatically — **no config change is required**. When ESPN reports `state: in`, the plugin switches to live picks, shows the current round, and marks the next pick on the clock.

**`live_priority`** controls whether the draft *interrupts* other plugins to take over the display exclusively. Leave it `false` to keep the draft in normal rotation alongside other plugins.

## Data Sources

- **Pre-draft**: [Tankathon](https://www.tankathon.com/nfl/mock_draft) mock draft (Round 1)
- **Live/post-draft**: ESPN public API — no API key required
- **Position data**: ESPN core API prospects (supplements live picks where position is unavailable inline)

## Requirements

- LEDMatrix v2.0.0 or higher
- Minimum display size: 64×32 pixels
- Python 3.9+
